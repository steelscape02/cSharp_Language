# Overview

This is an inventory management system in C#. This system uses a JSON data file to store inventory information. 
When the program is opened, the program reads in the data using a HashSet with a Contains override to compare 
items by ID to ensure no duplicate IDâ€™s are entered. This program will allow items to be added, removed, edited, and viewed. 

I wrote this program as an exploration of the C# language. The concept of an inventory manager is simple enough, and as such represents a good oppurtunity to learn the unique capabilities of the C# language.
